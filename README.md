# MetaHeuristic Platform Test (MHPlatTest)

MetaHeuristic Platform Test (MHPlatTest) is a .NET 8 platform for benchmarking and comparing metaheuristic optimization algorithms on a variety of numerical and process control problems. The platform is modular, extensible, and designed for research and educational purposes.

## Features

- **Multiple Metaheuristic Algorithms**: Includes AdaABC (Adaptive Artificial Bee Colony), DirectedABC, BasicABC, ImprovedABCAdaptiveMingZhao, GBestABC, MABC, ARABC, and more.
- **Benchmark Functions**: Supports a wide range of numerical benchmark functions and process control benchmarks (e.g., CSTR).
- **Batch Experimentation**: Easily run multiple repetitions and dimensions for statistical analysis.
- **Result Export**: Outputs results and statistics in CSV and JSON formats for further analysis.
- **Extensible**: Add new algorithms or benchmark functions by implementing the provided interfaces.

## Requirements

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- Visual Studio 2022 or later (recommended)
